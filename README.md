# Social Media Data Parsing and Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing social media page data from an unstructured text file. The goal is to convert raw textual information into structured JSON data and perform basic analytical insights using Python.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Read unstructured social media data from a text file
- Parse relevant information such as page name, category, posts, followers, and following
- Convert follower counts (K, M) into numeric values
- Store parsed data in a structured JSON format
- Perform basic data analysis and summary statistics

## 📂 Dataset
- **File Name:** `initialdata.txt`
- **Format:** Unstructured text
- **Content:** Social media page information including followers, posts, and categories

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- File Handling
- String Manipulation
- JSON
- Basic Data Analysis

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Read data from text file
2. Split data into meaningful chunks
3. Parse each chunk to extract key attributes
4. Convert numeric values to standard format
5. Store results in JSON
6. Analyze data to find:
   - Page with highest posts
   - Page with highest followers
   - Page with highest following
   - Number of unique categories

## 📊 Output
- Structured JSON representation of social media pages
- Printed analytics results in the console

## 📈 Sample Analysis Performed
- Maximum number of posts
- Maximum number of followers
- Maximum number of following
- Count of unique page categories

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Place `initialdata.txt` in the project directory
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script
3. View parsed JSON output and analytics results

## 📌 Use Cases
- Social media analytics
- Data preprocessing practice
